**PBOS** is an operating system developed in C# using CosmosOS.

# Features
- FAT32 file system **(UNSTABLE ON PHYSICAL HARDWARE)**
- A basic user system
- A basic shell
- Basic shell commands
- A desktop environment

# Running
- Install CosmosOS
- Download VMware Player
- `git clone` this repository (If you want to use the non-stable versions, currently there's no release)
- Run `dotnet build` (if you cloned the repository)
- Open VMware Player
- Create a new virtual machine and attach the ISO as the main disk image (Make sure to give it a hard disk image (Must be IDE!), about 256 MB should be good enough)
- Run it
